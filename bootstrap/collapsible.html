    Welcome to the community-driven documentation project for the Sublime Text editor!Sublime Text (opens new window)is a versatile, fun, and fast text editor for code and prose that automates repetitive tasks so you can focus on the important stuff. It is supported on macOS, Windows and Linux. Its versatility comes from a wide range of community-developed third-party packages that provide syntax highlighting, snippets, or other automation backed by Python (opens new window)plugins. The default distribution of Sublime Text aims to provide a basic but very functional set of features, but it can easily be turned into a full-fledged IDE, if so desired.
